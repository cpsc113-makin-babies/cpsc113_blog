  value: |
      For men and women who struggle with the awkward social and legal issues related
      to finding either female carriers or male sperm donors in order to have kids,
      our product is a mobile-first platform that connects would-be parents with the
      children of their dreams based off a series of preferences and attributes.
      We take care of all the connections and legal issues, so that you can focus on
      building your new family.
