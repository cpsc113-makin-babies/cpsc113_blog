      New pivot ideas
---
**NOTE - Busines Model Canvas has been updated**

**Customer Problem**
  After a long conversation with Jes Strumpf, weve identified a real customer problem.  Most surrogacy agencies have a very complex process of onboarding new clients (both supply and demand side) and most of the process is done manually right now.  See below.

**Idea**
  The new idea is to use The StorQ as a sort of CRM-like software for agencies.  They would use this to onboard their clients and carriers.  Have them build profiles with the information that is pertinant to their organization, fill out forms, track meetings, communication/ messaging etc.  Once they're ready to match the agency will add possible matches to profiles and IPs can browse for people they want to take the next step with.
  * We handle contracts, forms, sign-offs
  * We could manage the medical record release for carriers and get the info sent over to the agency
  * Users build profiles when they're onboarded and agency uses the software to manage their clients.'

**Notes**
  Most agencies are looking for some side of the market (carriers or parents), find a ways to get agencies access to more of what they need in order to run their businesses and they will pay.

**Questions to be answered**
  * How big would the market for this CRM-like software be?
    * Do clinics need this or is it only apropriate for agencies?
  * Will agencies pay for the platform?


***Surrogates*** - Surrogates will often work with one agency multiple times.
  * Application
    * When a surrogate connects with Jes, she will start by sending them an application.  This is the first step in getting to know the person and making sure they will be a good fit.  The application is usually emailed, printed, filled out, scanned and emailed back.
  * Medical records
    * Agency has the carrier fills out an agreement to have them pull her medical records. (email)
    * Once form is complete, agency will request pertinent med records from the applicant.  Look at previous pregnancies, STDs etc
  * Background checks
    * Agency will perform a background check through a service (check for criminal records etc)
  * Interview
    * Agency will schedule an interview prefer in person but skype is common.  Often takes 1-2 hours.  This is used as a check to see how committed the applicant is, assess their personality and motivations etc.
    * Agency will discuss deets and aspects important to the IPs and make sure they carrier is comfortable with everything etc.
  * Form sign off
    * Agency types up an agreement form listing important points from interview (ie termination, twins, med choices, parental ownership, visitation etc)
  * Match
  * Meetings w/ IPs
  * Carrier Agreement
    * Formalized agreement btw carrier and IPs (lawyer will draw this up)
  * Connect with clinic


***Intended Parents (IPs)*** - Onboarding could be as quick as 2 weeks if they have everything in order and find a quick match with a carrier.
  * Application
  * Interview
  * Survey
    * IPs fill out a survey to outline all of the points that are important to them (ie termination, twins, med choices, parental ownership, visitation etc)
  * Match
  * Meetings w/ carrier
    * If both IPs and Carrier are interested in the match, they will first chat over the phone with agency, then they will meet in-person.
  * Sign the carrier agreement
  * Connect with clinic
