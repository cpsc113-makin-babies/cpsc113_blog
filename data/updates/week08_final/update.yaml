  This week Dan focused on generating concrete numbers and a simple pro-forma for how to monetize.
news:
  - title: Acquisition and Monetization
    kind: joy
    description: |
      We were able to generate an acquisition and revenue model that projected breakeven in two months based on a PPC strategy that generated 9 registrations per day and a CAC of around $12.  We are expecting approximately a $50K annual burn rate (outside of salaries).  Our monetization strategy will be based upon one part acquisition through providing community services and education, and monitziation will be based on the Match.com model of connection and value-added partner referrals.  We want to make sure that this is a demand-side market, so service providers would never have to pay.
  - title: Finalizing a working site
    kind: learning

      We have finished creating a working site, complete with newsletter (currently devoid of content, but with content coming) as well as links to everything we have up currently.
  - title: Forming partnerships
    kind: learning
    description: |
      Throughout the process, we have talked with two fertility centers and four surrogacy agencies.  We also have a list of lawyers and psychiatrists that we can contact, to form further partnerships for our site.  Lastly, we are using findsurrogatemother.com as a source for supply-side users.
  - title: Pitching
    kind: joy
    description: |
      We created our pitch deck, which we can use to pitch to investors. In doing so, we have distilled our mission and market quite clearly, and we end by asking for $100,000 in seed money.
