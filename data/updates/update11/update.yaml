**NOTE - Business Model Canvas has been updated**

**Idea** -
In our last update we proposed the idea of creating a CRM-like software platform specifically designed for surrogacy agencies.  Although this is certainly an option, we may be limiting our potential impact by narrowing the scope of what we offer.  One of our major concerns in facilitating direct connections was the legal ramifications of cross-state surrogacy contracts.  Eddie H suggests that this may in fact be a barrier to entry for more competition and create valuable opportunity for us.

One idea is to start out by building the CRM software and then once we have a deeper understanding of the industry, expand out into offering matching services ourselves.

**Competition**
  * [Circle Surrogacy](http://www.circlesurrogacy.com/)
    * Largest surrogacy center in US
  * [Golden Surrogacy](https://goldensurrogacy.com/)
  * [Conceivabilities](https://www.conceiveabilities.com/)
    * They have some sort of matching algorithm

**Plans for Next Week**
  * Talk to 10 intended parents who are currently going through IVF and are planning to progress to surrogacy; what are they looking for?  Are they comfortable using a platform like StorQ (broad range, scientific approach)? What are their decision making factors?
  * Talk to 3x surrogacy agencies, how do they manage the client onboarding process, what are their pains?
