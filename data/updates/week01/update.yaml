  ways to make the project a reality.

**Makin Babies**

A secure, website that facilitates matching (initially through a directory
listing with filtering functionality, later, possibly, with an advanced
matching algorithm) of individuals who possess a specific good (surrogacy,
sperm donor, egg donor, or combination thereof)

**Who is your customer or customers?**
  * Our initial focus will be on gay men who are looking for surrogacy services in
    the New England and Mid Atlantic area.
    * This group is most acutely affected by the murky and complex area of surrogacy
  * As an this is a two sided marketplace, we will also need find female carriers to
    connect these couples with.

**What is their pain?**
These individualsâ€™ pains are the difficulty in sourcing reproductive health assistance,
identifying individuals who could be potential matches and fits, vetting these matches and fits,
and developing the framework and contract under which such a transaction would take place.

**What kind of software do you think will solve their pain?**
A secure, website that facilitates matching (initially through a directory listing with
filtering functionality, later, possibly, with an advanced matching algorithm) of
individuals who possess a specific good (surrogacy, sperm donor, egg donor,
or combination thereof), with additional services such as background checks,
and legal contracts (later, insurance, medication, and counseling).
Individuals on opposite sides of the supply and demand will be kept at arms l
ength from each other until they have monetized through a platform messaging system.

**How do you know these things?**
  * Each prospective family spends more than $150,000 on a us based surrogacy
  * Overall surrogacy success rate = 60 to 70%
    * Once surrogate is pregnant, the success rate is 95%
  * Total number of surrogate births is hard to estimate as countries do not report
    this
    * Estimated number of kids adopted through public child welfare agencies
      = 52,000/ year (2013)

**How will you reach these customers and convert them into users of your app?**
We will use word of mouth, AdWords and hopefully build a critical mass of network
 size to make this a viable option for everyone looking for surrogacy services

**How do you imagine that you would support this venture? Is it non-profit? Is it for profit?**
This venture will most likely be for profit.  We expect to follow a freemium model,
similar to that of many online matchmaking sites where individuals can create
profiles for free, but messaging and additional services (such as background
checks and legal contracts) would be charged.

**What are the biggest risks?**
The top five reasons for failing are the following:
  * Regulatory risks (what are the rules for connecting donors/ surrogates with
    prospective families?)
  * Collection of medical data (HIPAA).  Can we avoid collecting medical data,
    by acting solely as the intermediary, not the surrogacy agency?
  * Difficulty in building supply of donors/surrogates
  * Difficulty in building demand of donors/surrogates
  * Unexpected legal or regulatory issues with this venture
  * Compromised security reduces user trust
  * Poor coding and platform stability reducing user trust

**How to mitigate the risks?**
While there are risks inherent in any venture, due to the sensitivity of this
industry, risks can be reduced but not eliminated.
  * The primary risk for this venture will be confirming that this is in fact a
    problem for a significant number of users and that they will actually want to
    use the product. We will mitigate this immediately by going to talk to users,
    stakeholders, and people in the fertility and surrogacy industry.
  * The solution for two of the primary concerns- building supply and demand
    could be achieved through the creation of a multi-prong customer acquisition plan,
    for example, acquisition through partnerships with existing firms and operators
    in this space and through an e-mail campaign, realizing that the conversion
    rate for the latter option will be sub 0.6%.
  * The legal and regulatory issues are always a risk, and this risk could be
    mitigated through consultation with counsel.  We have very little control over
    regulatory risk, but personal legal risk can be mitigated through a corporate structure.
  * Security and trust in general, will be paramount to the customer's perception
    of our product.  Practicing a proactive security testing regimine and other
    best practices, such as significant password and data hashing will be critical.
  * Poor coding can be mitigated through test-driven development and regular code reviews.
    Further, the development process can be managed and should be managed through using
    the agile-scrum methodology to enable efficient planning and allocation of resources.

**Potential Impact**
 Our product will have a highly significant impact on users, namely having their first
 child (perhaps the most significant event in some lives). Although the product will
 have a large impact, we recognize that our focus will reduce the potential user base.
 Additionally, we recognize that there needs to be a critical mass of users in order for
 our product to be valuable (Network Effects). We will need to build a matchmaking platform
 but will also need to devote a significant amount of time on customer acquisition processes.

**Describe to us how the software will function. Try to phrase this in some kind of user narrative:
"As a user, I can log in. I can see XYZ, I can send a message to ABC", etc.**
As a user I can register with the platform and enter in my details and the parameters
of what service or individual I am seeking.  Following this, I would be redirected to
a directory of individual offerings of products or services that are congruent with
those that I would seek.  I would then choose a specific provider to message, and
then pay a nominal fee to communicate with this individual.  After this transaction,
I would be able to message back and forth - though any PII such as phone numbers,
e-mails and addresses would be obscured.  Once I am satisfied that this individual
is the person I want to choose, I would pay a larger nominal fee to recieve their contact
information.

**Technical Stack**
We will focus on building this platform nearly exclusively on the server, as a
security precaution.  Users will sumbit data through their profile, which we will encrypt securely.
We intend to store our data in a MongoDB architecture, which lends for the greatest
flexibility for scaling.  Our stack will additionally consist of Javascript, node.js,
express, and handlebars.  We will build tests to test our code and deploy our code in a
development environment prior to deploying to production.  As we will use agile scrum,
tasks will be divvied up into stories where we will use point poker to assign weights and
combine these stories into epics.

**Weekly Update: What we did last week**
  * In order to mitigate risk, we've contacted a number of stakeholders in order to figure out
    how the problem affects them and confirm that we are focused in the right area
      * We've contacted friends at BuzzFeed who specialize in women's health and surrogacy
        in order to get their input, access to their users, and potentially a survey
      * Found 7 fertility/ surrogacy clinics in the greater New Haven Area.  We are planning
        to visit these in person to interview stakeholders on Friday 3/4.
      * We set up a coffee chat with a friend who used to work in management at Planned
        Parenthood Southern New England.
**Goals: What we'll do next week**
      * Create a landing page to test market size, if people are interested, if they
        will value this.
      * Is this a real pain for gay men in New England/ mid-atlatic?
          * Answer this with interviews/ surveys
          * We have set up interviews with management at Planned Parenthood
