**Makin Babies: New name under consideration "Storkster"**

**Weekly Update: What we did last week**
  * In order to mitigate risk, we've contacted a number of stakeholders in order to figure out
    how the problem affects them and confirm that we are focused in the right area
    * We've contacted friends at BuzzFeed who specialize in women's health and surrogacy
      in order to get their input, access to their users, and potentially a survey
    * Found 7 fertility/ surrogacy clinics in the greater New Haven Area.  We are planning
      to visit these in person to interview stakeholders on Friday 3/4.
    * We set up a coffee chat with a friend who used to work in management at Planned
      Parenthood Southern New England.
    * We set up an initial landing page to gather emails of interested individuals (http://cpsc.strikingly.com/)

**Goals: What we'll do next week**
  * Market research: market size, current service, size of different customer segments, etc.
    * We do extensive Google research on the current services offered, as well as visiting fertility
      clinics in person in order to better understand the services.
    * Discovering market size will be quite a bit harder, as this is a very private service.
      We hope that trawling through fertility forums and looking at any available data will allow
      us to form at least a rough idea of the market size and what the different segments are.
  * What is the competition?
    * We believe that the competition includes adoption services. We will need to do research
      on how expensive our competition is, how their services differ, and what percentage of potential
      customers use certain competitors rather than others
  * What is people's willingness to be on a website? Does this vary by segment?
    * Based on social network demographics, people tend to be very willing to be on a website
      source (http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/08/21/report-social-network-demographics-in-2012/). That being
      said, we will be doing research on dating network demographics, as our product is more similar
      to a dating network than a mere social network.
  * Research regulatory environment for match makers
    * Dan is on this; doing TONS of legal research, and hopefully pulling in some Law students to help out
