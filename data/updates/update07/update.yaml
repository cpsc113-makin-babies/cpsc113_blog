**update**
  * We met with our TAs and went to office hours and the Hackathon.  We made great progress on the StorQ site.  It is now up and running; mongo is storing users; gridfs is storing and serving pictures; the landing page looks great; we're collecting emails and names from people interested.  Things are finally shaping up!
  * We still need to build the connection aspect of the site where we match people.
