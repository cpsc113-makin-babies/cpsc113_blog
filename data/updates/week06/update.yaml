**Makin Babies**

**Goals: What we'll do next week**
    * We are now focused on building.  We want to get user profiles up and running (pulling info from database and displaying info)
    * Once we have a BARE BONES MVP up and running, we want to release the product to beta users (including some of the orgs weve spoken with) to have them kick the tires
      * We will work behind the scenes to make connectings till we have our matching algorithm set.
    * We need to figure out what firewalls we will have in place and what well allow users to do
      * Dont want to offer features now, only to take them away later.
      * We want to be transparent with pricing upfront, but havent tested approprate pricing yet!
      * We need to get all the content polished and up so that we can show people the site.
