**Legal Issues**
We had a great conversation with Joyce Kauffman (family law lawyer who gave Howie counsel).  She informed us that she knows of similar connection/ parent matching organizations that have had criminal charges pressed against them.  Furthermore, she helped us understand that making a match is only the tip of the iceberg.  The real meat of the problem lies in all the logistics, legal contracting, partnerships with fertility clinics to actually perform the procedure etc.  After this conversation, we are skeptical that the idea in its initial form will be feasible.

**Pivot Ideas**
After this discouraging but valuable new information, we decied to lok for ways to pivot.  We identified two initial ideas below.
  * Sell directly to clinics and egg banks.  Use our platform as a sort of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software for these highly profitable and rapidly expanding businesses.
  * Create a platform where couples going through fertility issues can find data/ options and ideas/ connect with others.  Think PatientsLikeMe meets Yelp for fertility.
    * I've been impressed with what this site (https://www.fertilityiq.com/) has done to have users rate clinics and doctors, (too bad they beat us!), though these guys only address one small aspect of the market.
