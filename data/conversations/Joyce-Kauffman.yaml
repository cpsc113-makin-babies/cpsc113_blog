interviewee: Joyce Kauffman
summary: |
    Joyce is a family law lawyer based in Boston.  Nick was connected to her though Howie Forman.  Joyce is highly knowledgeable about regulation and legal considerations in the fertility industry.  She specializes in LGBT community issues.  When I presented the original idea for StorQ (a matching service) she expressed concern.  She informed us that she knows of similar connection/ parent matching organizations that have had criminal charges pressed against them.  Furthermore, she helped us understand that making a match is only the tip of the iceberg.  The real meat of the problem lies in all the logistics, legal contracting, partnerships with fertility clinics to actually perform the procedure etc.  After this conversation, we are skeptical that the idea in its initial form will be feasible.

    This conversation drove us to pivot the idea and consider other options.
