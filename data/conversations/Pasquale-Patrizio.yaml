questions:
  - q: Intro interview Friday, 6-24-16
    a: Met with Pasquale to learn more about Yale Fertility.  The meeting went well, he was very receptive to chatting about opportunities and industry problems.  He was not excited about Yelp for fertility clinics (FertilityIQ).  He sees a deficiency in information about surrogacy.  He recommended a Wiki for fertility focused on what the process is like, how long it takes, how much it costs, where to have procedures done, what success rates are, and also legal aspects (intended parents live here, surrogate lives there, what can be done etc etc).  Interesting notes - CT requires insurers to pay for 2x cycles of IVF (though they count the expensive removal of eggs one cycle, not implanting eggs which incentivises women to use insuance for the more expensive procedure rather than the most efficient procedure), also recommended checking out www.resolve.org
