      We spoke with Jes during class, but this was the second follow-up call.  Here are some of the important points from the discussion: Need software to make sure Intended Parents (IPs) and carriers understand all of the legal, financial, and time base commitments expected of them; Most agencies have a deficiency in surrogates and need more IPs but she has a surplus of IPs, Agencies get most referrals from internet; Relationships with clinics are important because they drive recommendations = $; IPs and surrogates will shop around with agencies, the most important factors is quality of service as most cost the same and most IPs are wealthy; Jes works with 4-5 matched couples at any one time; See [THIS LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w7IOjni2AzHJ8XKEtD0Z2DhFCifX8ptcCulu-bG7U5w/edit?usp=sharing) for info on typical surrogate/ IP timeline.  Recommended getting in touch with Monique Van Leuven RN at Northeastern Reproductive Medicine to talk to them about what they're up to.
