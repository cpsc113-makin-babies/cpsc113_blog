questions:
  - q: Where are you and your partner in the process?
    a: We are considering adoption, we had an opportunity to adopt fall into our lap (friend
      of friend knew a girl having a kid she wanted to give up, but then last minute went with
      another couple who lived closer to her).  After that fell through we decided that we're 5 to 6 years out.
  - q: What went into your decision process?
    a: Adoption agencies are expensive ($20k for domestic - international not an option cause most donate
      want to give kids to gay couples, and you need to stay there for 2-3mos).
  - q: Have you considered surrogacy?
    a: We are frugal and surrogacy is too expensive.
  - q: How will you go about looking when you start?
    a: I may contact an agency, there are some that cater to gay couples and know what to look for/
      avoid with people against same sex couples etc.  Other than that word of mouth is important.
