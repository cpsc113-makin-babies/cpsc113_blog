**Makin Babies**

A secure, website that facilitates matching (initially through a directory
listing with filtering functionality, later, possibly, with an advanced
matching algorithm) of individuals who possess a specific good (surrogacy,
sperm donor, egg donor, or combination thereof)

Who is your customer or customers?
  * A male individual or couple seeking a surrogate (and/or egg donor)
  * A male or female individual or couple seeking a surrogate and sperm donor (and/or egg donor)
  * A female individual or couple seeking a surrogate (and/or egg donor)
  * A female or couple seeking an egg donor
  * A male individual who wishes to be a sperm donor
  * A female individual who wishes to be a surrogate (and/or egg donor)

**What is their pain?**
These individualsâ€™ pains are the difficulty in sourcing reproductive health assistance,
identifying individuals who could be potential matches and fits, vetting these matches and fits,
and developing the framework and contract under which such a transaction would take place.

**What kind of software do you think will solve their pain?**
A secure, website that facilitates matching (initially through a directory listing with
filtering functionality, later, possibly, with an advanced matching algorithm) of
individuals who possess a specific good (surrogacy, sperm donor, egg donor,
or combination thereof), with additional services such as background checks,
and legal contracts (later, insurance, medication, and counseling).
Individuals on opposite sides of the supply and demand will be kept at arms l
ength from each other until they have monetized through a platform messaging system.

**How do you know these things?**
[Insert Research]

**How will you reach these customers and convert them into users of your app?**
We will use word of mouth, AdWords and hopefully build a critical mass of network
 size to make this a viable option for everyone looking for surrogacy services

**How do you imagine that you would support this venture? Is it non-profit? Is it for profit?**
This venture will most likely be for profit.  We expect to follow a freemium model,
similar to that of many online matchmaking sites where individuals can create
profiles for free, but messaging and additional services (such as background
checks and legal contracts) would be charged.

**What are the biggest risks?**
The top five reasons for failing are the following:
  * Difficulty in building supply of donors/surrogates
  * Difficulty in building demand of donors/surrogates
  * Unexpected legal or regulatory issues with this venture
  * Compromised security reduces user trust
  * Poor coding and platform stability reducing user trust

**How to mitigate the risks?**
While there are risks inherent in any venture, due to the sensitivity of this
industry, risks can be reduced but not eliminated.
  * The solution for the first two primary concerns- building supply and demand
    could be achieved through the creation of a multi-prong customer acquisition plan,
    for example, acquisition through partnerships with existing firms and operators
    in this space and through an e-mail campaign, realizing that the conversion
    rate for the latter option will be sub 0.6%.
  * The legal and regulatory issues are always a risk, and this risk could be
    mitigated through consultation with counsel.  We have very little control over
    regulatory risk, but personal legal risk can be mitigated through a corporate structure.
  * Security and trust in general, will be paramount to the customer's perception
    of our product.  Practicing a proactive security testing regimine and other
    best practices, such as significant password and data hashing will be critical.
  * Poor coding can be mitigated through test-driven development and regular code reviews.
    Further, the development process can be managed and should be managed through using
    the agile-scrum methodology to enable efficient planning and allocation of resources.

**Potential Impact**
Our calculus for measuring impact will focus on the meaningful connection of a
few customers, compared to the acquisition of many individuals on our platform.
The primary reason for this is due to the constraints of the time limit of the
number of this project.  We will need to build a matchmaking platform but will also
need to devote a significant amount of time on customer acquisition processes.

**Describe to us how the software will function. Try to phrase this in some kind of user narrative:
"As a user, I can log in. I can see XYZ, I can send a message to ABC", etc.**
As a user I can register with the platform and enter in my details and the parameters
of what service or individual I am seeking.  Following this, I would be redirected to
a directory of individual offerings of products or services that are congruent with
those that I would seek.  I would then choose a specific provider to message, and
then pay a nominal fee to communicate with this individual.  After this transaction,
I would be able to message back and forth - though any PII such as phone numbers,
e-mails and addresses would be obscured.  Once I am satisfied that this individual
is the person I want to choose, I would pay a larger nominal fee to recieve their contact
information.

**Technical Stack**
We will focus on building this platform nearly exclusively on the server, as a
security precaution.  The data will be hashed prior to submission for security reasons.
We intend to store our data in a MongoDB architecture, which lends for the greatest
flexibility for scaling.  Our stack will additionally consist of Javascript, node.js,
express, and handlebars.  We will build tests to test our code and deploy our code in a
development environment prior to deploying to production.  As we will use agile scrum,
tasks will be divvied up into stories where we will use point poker to assign weights and
combine these stories into epics.
