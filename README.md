# StorQ Progress Blog

This is a blog I created to track progress on The StorQ, conversations we have and how the idea evolves.

## Note: if re-installing the blog, you will need to do the following...

  npm install

Then, you can install the client-side dependencies with

  ./node_modules/.bin/bower install

Then, you can run the application with nodemon using the following command:

  PORT=4000 ./node_modules/.bin/nodemon -e 'js,html,yaml,css' index.js
